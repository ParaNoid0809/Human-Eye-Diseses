🏥 Retinal OCT Analysis Platform – AI-Powered Retinal Disease Detection

🚀 Deep Learning for Eye Health
The Retinal OCT Analysis Platform is an AI-powered web application that leverages deep learning to analyze Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans. It assists in the early detection of critical eye conditions like Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD).
